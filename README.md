**Slow** - Because the command line is just way too fast

story

I really like the command line. I like how it provides a simple, clean interface, I like how it's considerably faster to do things than using GUIs, and I like how all my classmates sitting behind me in class think I'm a 1337 h4x00r or whatever while I'm typing this readme file. There's just... There's just one thing.

It's too fast.

Things just kinda happen. Lines appear on the screen, you have to read them, it's just awful. It's stressful. It's scary. Slow is the solution to this. Slow interrupts the output to your command line, and prints them out in a slower, simpler, more motion oriented way. Remember kids, the goal is not performance, the goal is to avoid causing anxiety in your users or whatever excuse material design uses for making 90Mb ui frameworks.
